    <h1>Man i love frogs!</h1>
    <h2>Why my favorite pet is frog?</h2>
    <p>A frog is a passive mob found in swamps. Frogs eat small slimes and magma cubes. A frog can produce one of three <br>
        kinds of froglights from eating magma cubes, depending on the type of frog.</p>
    <p>In water, frogs move much faster. They will generally swim upwards and remain at the water's surface, but will swim <br>
        downwards if lured by a player. Frogs cannot be hurt by drowning.</p>

    <h2>Cool behavior</h2>
    <p>Frogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth, whereupon the mob instantly despawns.<br>
        Frogs attack small slimes, which drop slimeballs when killed.</p>
