    <h2>Tesla members</h2>
    <p>
        Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s <br>
        transition to sustainable energy. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in <br>
        2008, followed by the Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched<br>
         in 2015. Model S received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate Car of the <br>
         Year by Motor Trend, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category <br>
         and sub-category in the
    </p>
    <p>
        National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began deliveries of Model 3, <br>
        a mass-market electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled Tesla Semi, which is designed <br>
        to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, <br>
        which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car, as well as the Model <br>
        Y compact SUV, which began customer deliveries in early 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tesla also produces three energy storage products, the Powerwall home battery, the Powerpack <br>
        commercial-scale battery, and Megapack, which is designed for utility-scale installations. In 2016, <br>
        Tesla became the world’s first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company with the acquisition of <br>
        SolarCity, the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States, and in 2017 released Solar Roof – <br>
        a beautiful and affordable energy generation product.

   <h3>Ferrari</h3>
   <div>
    <p>Ferrari NV (short: Ferrari — Rus. "Ferrari") is an Italian company producing sports and racing cars, <br>
        based in Maranello. Founded in 1947 by Enzo Ferrari as Scuderia Ferrari, the company sponsored racers and produced<br>
         racing cars until 1947. Since 1947, the company began producing sports cars authorized for use on public roads under <br>
         the brand name "Ferrari S.p.A." Throughout its history, the company participates in various races, especially in Formula 1, <br>
         where it has the greatest success. The Ferrari emblem is a prancing stallion on a yellow background. The traditional color of cars <br>
         is red, but the company produces cars in other colors as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The racing team, called "Scuderia Ferrari" (Scuderia Ferrari) was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929. It began to produce vehicles only in 1947.<br>
        Fiat SpA acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988. In October 2014, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (SA) <br>
        announced its intentions to separate Ferrari SpA from FCA; at the time of the announcement, FCA owned 90% of Ferrari. The separation <br>
        began in October 2015 with a restructuring, as a result of which Ferrari NV (a company registered in the Netherlands) became the new <br>
        holding company of the Ferrari group, and the subsequent sale of 10% of shares to FCA during the IPO and simultaneous listing of <br>
        shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In the remaining stages of the split, FCA's share in the Ferrari business was distributed <br>
        among FCA shareholders, 10% of which are still owned by Piero Ferrari. The allocation was completed on January 3, 2016.<br>
