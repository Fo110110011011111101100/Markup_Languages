    <h1>Motor</h1>
    <p>
        Left rear-wheel drive (one large electric motor). In the center is a four-wheel drive stock car (two small electric motors). On the right is the Performance sports version (small + large electric motor).<br>
        The declared power of a top-end car is already 773 Hp (270 Hp in front and 503 Hp in the rear). So why have we achieved such impressive indicators?<br>
        The answer is simple, they didn't invent anything new. A good old asynchronous motor was taken, it was strongly modified and boosted in speed (Max RPM 16,000 rpm). Yes, yes, I was not mistaken with zeros!<br>
        The traction electric motor in their cars Tesla calls Drive Unit (Drive).

        The rear traction asynchronous electric motor with a copper rotor has a peak of 503 Hp, and the maximum engine speed is 16,000 rpm.<br>
        The Drive Unit is located between the rear wheels of the car, which gives enormous advantages in saving space under the hood. On the left is a traction electric motor, on the right is an inverter <br>
        (a device that converts direct current from a traction battery into alternating current for an electric motor). Many people think that these are two electric motors)))

    <h2>Rotor</h2>
    <p>
        Electric motor rotor with a copper squirrel cage (cheaper electric motors with an aluminum rotor are usually used in industry)<br>
        Tesla motors inverter with the protective cover removed<br>
        There is no gearbox on the car at all. It was replaced by a gearbox with a gear ratio of 9.73. The transmission is always the same, the electric motor is mechanically constantly connected to the wheels.

        The scheme of operation of the entire transmission is quite simple. The inverter of the electric motor is powered by a traction battery with a voltage of 400 volts direct current. <br>
        Then it converts it into alternating current and feeds the electric motor with it. Peak current values can reach a whopping 1400 amps!<br>
        Unfortunately, the claimed 773 hp is just a peak short-term value of the maximum power of the car. In practice, there is a lower power, but we will talk about this later.
